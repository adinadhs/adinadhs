●	Utilized the React.JS framework to create a single-page application (SPA) that can bind data to specific views and synchronize data with the server.
●	Executed and maintained monitoring and alerting of production and corporate servers such as EC2 and storage such as S3 buckets using AWS Cloud Watch.
●	Improved application efficiency by Spring Boot's optimization techniques, such as Spring Data JPA and caching mechanisms.
●	Applied data binding and validation functionalities within Spring MVC controllers, leading to a 20% decrease in data integrity errors during user input processing.
●	Used Spring Security, JWT and OAuth2 to establish robust authentication and authorization frameworks for applications.
●	Established a GraphQL API to efficiently query data from diverse sources, enabling real-time visualization of key metrics through integrated Grafana dashboards increasing data retrieval efficiency by 30%.

University of Louisiana at Lafayette | Graduate Research Assistant				             

•	Utilized React concepts like hooks and functional programming to construct reusable and maintainable components, reducing development time. 
•	Designed and developed the End Points (Controllers), Business Layer, and DAO Layer using the Hibernate/JDBC template.

Zensar Technologies, India | Software Engineer                                                                                                                

●	Utilized React hooks and functional programming to build reusable and maintainable components, reducing development time. 
●	Developed the End Points (Controllers), Business Layer, and DAO Layer using the Hibernate/JDBC template, using Spring IOC (Dependency Injection).
●	Led the migration from production MySQL (AWS RDS) to Amazon Redshift for querying analytical workload which reduced API latency by over 70% and 30% decrease in database resource contention.
●	Managed Postman to design and execute API requests, facilitating thorough testing of the application's backend.
●	Used SoapUI to diagnose and troubleshoot REST API and SOAP integration problems, working closely with backend developers to ensure seamless API functionality.
●	Developed Spring Boot microservices using RESTful APIs, achieving a 20% improvement in application response time.
●	Performed CRUD operations like Updating, Inserting, and Deleting data in MongoDB and SQL Server and handling database access and data transmission based on RESTful web service.
●	Integrated Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task for asynchronous messaging and task execution, enabling loosely coupled microservices communication.
